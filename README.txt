 Write an executible program that moves all files in the downloads folder
  to their respective folders 
 
1. First get it to work on own computer --> check!
2. Then, modify it so someone can enter their own paths/destinations --> check!
3. Make it an executible --> check!
4. Make it work on macos
5. Make it a general organizer, not just for downloads --> check!
6. Print out how much files were moved

Still have to solve the manual exit.
